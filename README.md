A modern web application built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and better-sqlite3 for database management. This project includes features for student predictions, feedback, authentication, and more.

## Features
- Student registration and authentication
- Prediction and feedback system
- Admin dashboard
- PDF generation
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Uses better-sqlite3 for fast, reliable local database

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or use npm/yarn, but pnpm is recommended)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development
To start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for Production
To build the app for production:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
To start the production server:
```bash
pnpm run start
```

### Database
- The app uses a local SQLite database (`database.db`) created automatically in the project root.
- Tables for students, predictions, and feedback are created on first run.

### Environment Variables
If you need to add environment variables (e.g., for API keys), create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. Example:
```
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
